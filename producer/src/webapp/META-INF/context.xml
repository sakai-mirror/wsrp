<!-- 
	Define a separate Realm for WSRP Producer. This is to support authentication of WSRP Consumer Portal 
	rather than the authentication of each end-user that the consumer portal acts on behalf of.
	
	Since the WSRP Consumer is being authenticated, it doesn't necessarily make sense to map it to 
	a normal Sakai user (who are likely to be end-users). Hence, a separate file is created here
	that can be populated with username/passwords of trusted WSRP consumers.
	
	To enable authentication, you MUST enable the <security-constraint> in web.xml, which is
	disabled by default.
	
	Ofcourse, you can always change the realm implementation class to leverage your own or one
	of the other standard Realm implementations provided by the app server (tomcat).
